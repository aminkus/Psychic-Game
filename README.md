# Psychic-Game

This is a simple game of letter guess, where the user gets 10 attempts to guess a randomized letter. The program generates a random letter from the characters of the engligh alphabet and gives the user ten tries to guess the letter. The letter guessed is displayed to the user and the  guesses remaining counter decreases until either a "you lose" alert pops up or "you win" alert pops up.
## Getting Started

Building the variables to the game was straightforward. I needed to have a few counters, a variable to store the event listener, and an empty array to push the users guesses into in order to diplay it back the to them. I then needed to build the logic, which took a bit of re working but I finally got it. The program also needed to be able to dynamically change the html and for that I had to deploy the "document.getElementById" method.
